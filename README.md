Proud to share my latest mini web project – WeatherNow, a responsive and clean weather forecast application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature and weather description for any city. A perfect example of integrating third-party APIs into web apps!

⚙️ Key Features:
Real-time weather updates

Clean and modern UI

Built using Fetch API

Responsive design

Easy to customize and expand
